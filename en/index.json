Far-field Mach waves and near-field ground motion confirmed the supershear nature. This exceptionally long supershear rupture caused severe building collapse and soil liquefaction, as observed in satellite imagery, offering insights into the damage potential of such ruptures in urban areas. The sustained supershear propagation was facilitated by fault's linear geometry, prolonged interseismic quiescence, favorable energy ratio, and pronounced bimaterial contrasts across the fault interface. These findings underscore the roles of fault structure, stress accumulation, and material contrasts in governing rupture dynamics, demonstrating that large-scale supershear propagation can occur in complex continental fault systems.","tags":null,"title":"Bimaterial effect and favorable energy ratio enabled supershear rupture in the 2025 Mandalay earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1746066237,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1746066237,"objectID":"f068114b50aa85ffe1cb83e063e816e8","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/17-jgr-2025/","publishdate":"2025-05-01T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/17-jgr-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Classical theories using linear elasticity predict that crack propagation asymptotically approaches a limiting speed, beyond which the energy balance becomes unphysical.

The simulated terminal speed spans a continuum of values, ranging from slow ruptures to supershear ruptures. We then develop a new theory incorporating viscoelasticity to predict all simulated rupture speeds. In addition to the ratio of fracture energy to static energy release rate, we find that three length scales also play a crucial role in governing the energy balance during rupture in viscoelastic materials. The theory predicts that stable rupture speeds are energetically allowed to be very small, which helps explain the widespread occurrence of slow earthquakes. Beyond the classical speed limit, the energy balance becomes independent of macroscopic length scales, being controlled solely by the local properties around the rupture tip. Furthermore, we find that the effects of viscoelasticity in fault zones are significant in earthquake rupture propagation, even when the fault-zone geometrical scales are short relative to other fault dimensions.

Here, we show that the rupture propagation of simulated slow and fast earthquakes can be predicted by a newly-developed three-dimensional theory of dynamic fracture mechanics accounting for finite rupture width, an essential ingredient missing in previous theories. The complete spectrum of rupture speeds is controlled by the ratio of fracture energy to energy release rate. Shear stress heterogeneity can produce a cubic scaling on a single fault while effective normal stress variability produces a linear scaling on a population of faults, which reconciles the debated scaling relations.

Because slow slip events occur worldwide and could trigger devastating earthquakes, geophysicists are particularly interested in understanding their fundamental mechanics and their relationship with the fast, damaging earthquakes. A yet unsolved piece of the puzzle is the empirical relation between the magnitude and duration of both types of earthquakes: it is still debated whether or not this relation is similar for slow slip events and regular earthquakes.\nWe found that both slow and fast earthquakes can be understood by a new theory of dynamic fracture mechanics. This theory accounts for an essential ingredient that was missing in previous models and experiments, the “finite seismogenic depth”: the portion of the fault that slides during a large event has a limited depth extent, shorter than its horizontal length. The predictions of the new model are supported by validations against earthquake simulations and observations.\nThe work provides insight on how earthquakes can develop a broad spectrum of rupture speeds, from arbitrarily slow ones to seismic wave speeds. In particular, the new model shows how earthquake rupture speed is controlled by a non-dimensional number arising from energy balance: the ratio between the available elastic energy and the energy dissipated by fault slip. The model also reconciles the debated observations of the relation between magnitude and duration of slow slip events. It explains how this relation can be similar to that of regular earthquakes when focusing on events from a single region, but radically different when combining observations from multiple regions.\n","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"f87232917e853984ceec01a72379b9e4","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/project/slow_and_fast_eqs/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/slow_and_fast_eqs/","section":"project","summary":"A new theoretical model elucidating the fundamental connections between slow and fast earthquakes.","tags":["Slow earthquakes"],"title":"Slow and fast earthquakes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"860a57a0e3ba92cf18d9a274bf91b5a2","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/teaching/2022-seismology/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/2022-seismology/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"2022 Seismology","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng*","Jean-Paul Ampuero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"38acf78cacabcccf0c9bfc06ffe0fc8b","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/12-ng-2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/12-ng-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Earthquake rupture speed can affect ground shaking and therefore seismic hazard. Seismological observations show that large earthquakes span a continuum of rupture speeds, from slower than Rayleigh waves up to P-wave speed, and include speeds that are predicted to be unstable by two-dimensional theory. This discrepancy between observations and theory has not yet been reconciled by a quantitative model. Here we present numerical simulations that show that long ruptures with oblique slip (both strike-slip and dip-slip components) can propagate steadily at various speeds, including those previously suggested to be unstable. The obliqueness of slip and the ratio of fracture energy to static energy release rate primarily control the propagation speed of long ruptures. We find that the effects of these controls on rupture speed can be predicted by extending the three-dimensional theory of fracture mechanics to long ruptures with oblique slip. This model advances our ability to interpret supershear earthquakes, to constrain the energy ratio of faults based on observed rupture speed and rake angle, and to relate the potential rupture speed and size of future earthquakes to the observed slip deficit along faults.","tags":null,"title":"Continuum of earthquake rupture speeds enabled by oblique slip","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Among the most damaging natural hazards, earthquakes are still today one of the least understood phenomena in Earth Sciences. Earthquakes happen when rocks on either side of a tectonic fault slide. The sliding, however, does not occur along the whole fault at once but starts at one point, the hypocenter, and then spreads over the entire fault at a speed known as the “rupture speed” of the earthquake. Geophysicists are particularly interested in rupture speeds because the faster they are, the stronger the seismic waves and therefore the greater the damage caused.\nSeismic models developed so far concluded that earthquakes could not propagate in a stable and sustainable way at arbitrary speeds. Scientists had therefore determined a forbidden speed range situated between the speed of P and S waves, the two main seismic waves that propagate through the Earth. However, progress in the seismological observation of earthquakes has made it possible to demonstrate that recent earthquakes had actually propagated within the forbidden range. Such was the case for the 2018 earthquake in Palu, Indonesia, for example, which caused a destructive tsunami.\nWe managed to overcome two crucial limitations of the previous models.

The impact of the earthquake can become more catastrophic by triggered phenomena, like landslides and tsunamis, as witnessed during the 2018 Palu (Indonesia) earthquake of magnitude 7.5. Generally, the faster the earthquake rupture, the stronger the shaking. The Palu earthquake is among a class of very fast but rare earthquakes whose speed exceeds that of shearing waves in rocks. Theoretically, these so-called “supershear earthquakes” can propagate steadily only if faster than a speed known as Eshelby's speed. Surprisingly, the Palu earthquake is slower than this limit. How can we explain this unusual speed? Did it affect the triggering of landslides, including submarine landslides that likely contributed to the tsunami? We address these questions through computer simulations, particularly focusing on the possible effect of a “fault damage zone,” a layer of softened rocks surrounding faults and caused by rock fracturing accumulated throughout the past fault activity. We found that, if a damage zone exists around the Palu fault, it can explain the unusual speed of this supershear earthquake and may have had the beneficial effect of reducing the shaking and thus its induced landslide and tsunami hazards in Palu.","tags":null,"title":"Does a damaged fault zone mitigate the near-field impact of supershear earthquakes?

Here, we test the determinism of interseismic locking models using spontaneous rupture simulations and the well-resolved processes associated with the 2012 moment magnitude (Mw) 7.6 Nicoya earthquake. To do so, we estimate initial megathrust stress from locking by assuming that the entire slip deficit will be released in the next megathrust earthquake. Then we initiate spontaneous ruptures at the hypocenter of the 2012 Nicoya earthquake. We find scenarios that approximate the same coseismic slip distribution and final earthquake moment magnitude as obtained from seismic and geodetic observations, demonstrating that deriving potential rupture scenarios from interseismic locking is feasible. We also find that spontaneous rupture scenarios from different locking models differ in moment rate duration and thus ground motion prediction, although the final slip distribution and moment magnitude were similar. The results highlight that quantifying rupture scenarios and ground motions from reliable locking models by dynamic rupture simulations can be an effective tool for seismic hazard assessment in subduction zones.","tags":null,"title":"Deriving rupture scenarios from interseismic locking distributions along the subduction megathrust","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567382400,"objectID":"0064615b7ffe5b784fa8c756ba3bbec7","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/teaching/ictp/","publishdate":"2019-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/ictp/","section":"teaching","summary":"2019 Advanced Workshop on Earthquake Fault Mechanics: Theory, Simulation and Observations at ICTP, Trieste, Italy","tags":null,"title":"2019 International summer schools","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The dynamics of ruptures in 3-D dynamic rupture simulations can be well described by the following inertial equation-of-motion:\n$F(G_c/G_0) = M(v_r) \\cdot \\dot{v}_r$\nwhere $G_c$ is the fracture energy, $G_0$ is the static energy release rate, $v_r$ is the ruptuer speed, $\\dot{v}_r$ is the rupture acceleration, $F()$ and $M()$ are the known “Force” and “Mass” terms.\n","date":1565740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565740800,"objectID":"3ee6e4919b28ed93ce01a713585018ab","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/project/equation-of-motion/","publishdate":"2019-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/equation-of-motion/","section":"project","summary":"A new 3D theory to predict rupture propagation in a fault with finite width.","tags":["Rupture dynamics"],"title":"New 3D rupture theory","type":"project"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng*","Jean-Paul Ampuero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564453437,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564453437,"objectID":"9deffcd9252586248604c2d3e8371abc","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/10-jgr-2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-30T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/10-jgr-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The largest earthquakes propagate laterally after saturating the fault's seismogenic width and reach large length-to-width ratios L/W. Smaller earthquakes can also develop elongated ruptures due to confinement by heterogeneities of initial stresses or material properties. The energetics of such elongated ruptures is radically different from that of conventional circular crack models: they feature width-limited rather than length-dependent energy release rate. However, a synoptic understanding of their dynamics is still missing. Here we combine computational and analytical modeling of long ruptures in three dimension (3D) and 2.5D (width-averaged) to develop a theoretical relation between the evolution of rupture speed and the along-strike distribution of fault stress, fracture energy, and rupture width. We find that the evolution of elongated ruptures in our simulations is well described by the following rupture-tip-equation-of-motion,  equation 1,where Gc is the fracture energy, G0 is the steady state energy release rate, vs is the S wave speed, vr is the rupture speed,  urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb53646:jgrb53646-math-0002 is the rupture acceleration, and  urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb53646:jgrb53646-math-0003 is a known function of rupture speed. The steady energy release rate is limited by rupture width as G0 = γ∆τ2W/μ, where γ is a geometric factor, ∆τ is the stress drop (spatially smoothed over a length scale smaller than W), and μ is the shear modulus. If Gc is a constant and exactly balanced by G0, the rupture can in principle propagate steadily at any speed. If Gc increases with rupture speed, steady ruptures have a well-defined speed and are stable. When Gc ≠ G0, the rupture acquires an inertial effect: the rupture-tip-equation-of-motion depends explicitly on rupture acceleration. This inertial effect does not exist in the classical theory of dynamic rupture in 2-D unbounded media and in unbounded faults in 3D, but emerges in 2-D bounded media or, as shown here, as a consequence of the finite rupture width in 3D. These findings highlight the essential role of the seismogenic width on rupture dynamics. Based on the rupture-tip-equation-of-motion we define the rupture potential, a function that determines the size of next earthquake, and we propose a conceptual model that helps rationalize one type of “supercycles” observed on segmented faults. More generally, the theory developed here can yield relations between earthquake source properties (final magnitude, moment rate function, radiated energy) and the heterogeneities of stress and strength along the fault, which can then be used to extract statistical information on fault heterogeneity from source time functions of past earthquakes or as physics-based constraints on finite-fault source inversion and on seismic hazard assessment.","tags":null,"title":"The dynamics of elongated earthquake ruptures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng","Hongfeng Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532399037,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532399037,"objectID":"52c7727ffd2c47c19d3f1f6e30f7a8fe","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/8-jgr-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-24T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/8-jgr-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Frictional properties of seismogenic faults play critical roles in earthquake generation and rupture propagation.

The seismic moments of these self-arresting ruptures increase with the nucleation size, forming nucleation-related events. The aspect ratios increase with the seismogenic width but are smaller than 8. In contrast, ruptures become breakaway and tend to have high aspect ratios (\u003e8) if the seismogenic width is sufficiently large.

In addition, the promotional effects increase with the width and depth extent of damage fault zones. The overall effects of the waves reflected from the fault-parallel side boundaries of damage fault zones are unfavorable for rupture propagation. Therefore, rupture propagation is promoted with the increased width of fault zones due to geometrical spreading effects.

In this study, we apply the compressive sensing method (CS) to invert for the spatiotemporal distribution of the coseismic radiation at different frequencies of this event. The results show clear frequency-dependent feature of earthquake rupture with low-frequency (LF) radiation located in the updip region while high-frequency (HF) radiation concentrated in the downdip region of the megathrust. We also compare the CS results with three coseismic slip models as well as the stress drop distributions inferred from these slip models. The comparison confirms our understanding of coseismic radiation that energy sources are mostly located in the margin of large coseismic slip regions. Furthermore, we find that the LF radiation sources are mainly within the stress-decreasing (releasing) regions while the HF radiation sources are mainly located in the stress-increasing (loading) regions due to rupturing of relatively large asperities nearby (stress decreasing and releasing). These results help to better understand the physics of the rupture process during megathrust earthquakes.

These so-called post-seismic deformations include contributions mainly from afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation, quantification of their relative influence is of importance for understanding the evolution of post-seismic crustal stress, strain and aftershocks. Here, we investigate the post-seismic deformation processes following the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake using surface displacement data as observed by the onshore global positioning system network in the first ∼1.5 yr following the main shock. We explore two different inversion modelling strategies: (i) we simulate pure afterslip and (ii) we simulate the combined effect of afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation. By assuming that the afterslip is solely responsible for the observed post-seismic deformation, we find most afterslip activities to be located close to the downdip area of the coseismic rupture at 20–80 km depth with a maximum cumulative slip of ∼3.8 m and a seismic moment of 2.3 × 1022 Nm, equivalent in moment to an Mw 8.84 earthquake. By assuming a combination of afterslip and viscoelastic components, the best data fit is found for an afterslip portion that is spatially consistent with the pure afterslip model, but reveals a decreased seismic moment of 2.1 × 1022 Nm, or Mw 8.82. In addition, the combined model suggests an effective thickness of the elastic crust of ∼50 km overlying an asthenosphere with a Maxwell viscosity of 2 × 1019 Pa s. Temporal analysis of our model inversions suggests that the rate of afterslip rapidly decreases with time, consistent with the state- and rate-strengthening frictional law. The spatial pattern of afterslip coincides with the locations of aftershocks, and also with the area of coseismically increased Coulomb failure stress (CFS). Only a small part of the coseismically increased CFS was released by the afterslip in 564 d after the event. The effect of the viscoelastic relaxation within this initial stage only plays a secondary role, but it shows an increasing tendency, that is, the contribution of viscoelastic relaxation increases with time. Further geodetic observations are needed for a robust quantification of the role of the viscoelastic relaxation in the post-seismic deformation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Overlapping post-seismic deformation processes: afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation following the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku (Japan) earthquake","type":"publication"}]
