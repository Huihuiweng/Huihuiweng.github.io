propagation is bounded by a limiting speed, beyond which the energy balance becomes unphysical. Recent experiments in viscoelastic materials demonstrated that both tensile and frictional crack propagation can exceed classical speed limits. However, the fundamental physics governing unbounded rupture speeds are still unclear. Numerical simulations show that frictional ruptures in viscoelasticity can propagate at a continuum of terminal speeds that are not bounded by the classical speed limit. All simulated rupture speeds are predicted by the newly developed theory of fracture mechanics incorporating viscoelasticity via the principle of energy balance. In addition to the ratio of the fracture energy to the static energy release rate that can be used to uniquely predict the rupture propagation in linear elasticity, the scales of characteristic lengths in viscoelasticity also govern the energy balance. Beyond the classical speed limit, the energy balance becomes independent of any macroscopic length and is controlled only by the local properties around the rupture tip. These numerical and theoretical findings fundamentally advance our understanding of dynamic rupture propagation.\n","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1711929600,"objectID":"99d5e5c51bd59a1be1982debe2a238e3","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/project/viscoelastic_ruptures/","publishdate":"2024-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/viscoelastic_ruptures/","section":"project","summary":"新理论模型显示粘弹性破裂可以超越传统理论预测的极限速度","tags":["Viscoelastic

slip events occur worldwide and could trigger devastating earthquakes, yet it is still debated whether their moment-duration scaling is linear or cubic and a fundamental model unifying slow and fast earthquakes is still lacking. Here, we show that the rupture propagation of simulated slow and fast earthquakes can be predicted by a newly-developed three-dimensional theory of dynamic fracture mechanics accounting for finite rupture width, an essential ingredient missing in previous theories. The complete spectrum of rupture speeds is controlled by the ratio of fracture energy to energy release rate. Shear stress heterogeneity can produce a cubic scaling on a single fault while effective normal stress variability produces a linear scaling on a population of faults, which reconciles the debated scaling relations. This model provides a new framework to explain how slow slip might lead to earthquakes and opens new avenues for seismic hazard assessment integrating seismological, laboratory and theoretical developments.","tags":null,"title":"Integrated rupture mechanics for slow slip events and earthquakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"快地震通常会在极短的时间内释放存储在地底下的弹性能，并辐射很强的地震波；而有一类特殊的慢地震（slow slip events）则破裂得非常温和，以至于监测不到地震波。这类慢地震非常普遍地存在，且被认为可能触发毁灭性大地震，然而目前对慢地震机理的认识还存在争议。因此人们非常希望能够了解这类慢地震的内在破裂机制及其与快地震的联系。\n本研究发现慢地震和快地震都可以用同一个三维破裂理论来描述。该理论考虑了经典破裂理论所忽视而地震学普遍观测到的一个重要因素：破裂面在深度方向上扩张受限导致破裂宽度要小于破裂长度。新破裂理论模型通过了数值模拟和地震学观测的验证，并提供了一个可以同时解释“快如火箭” 与“慢如蜗牛”的地震的理论依据：前者要求弹性能大于破裂能；后者要求两个能量平衡。\n此外，该文章还利用新理论模型解释了关于慢滑移尺度关系的争论。这个模型的一个重要应用价值是它提供了一个可以结合地震学观测、实验室观测及数值模拟的理论框架，未来可用于研究慢地震如何触发毁灭性大地震。\n","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"f87232917e853984ceec01a72379b9e4","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/project/slow_and_fast_eqs/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/slow_and_fast_eqs/","section":"project","summary":"揭示了慢地震的破裂机理及其与快地震的联系","tags":["Slow earthquakes"],"title":"地震破裂速度的快与慢","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"860a57a0e3ba92cf18d9a274bf91b5a2","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/teaching/2022-seismology/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/2022-seismology/","section":"teaching","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"2022地震学","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng*","Jean-Paul Ampuero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"38acf78cacabcccf0c9bfc06ffe0fc8b","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/publication/journal_papers/12-ng-2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_papers/12-ng-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Earthquake rupture speed can affect ground shaking and therefore seismic hazard. Seismological observations show that large earthquakes span a continuum of rupture speeds, from slower than Rayleigh waves up to P-wave speed, and include speeds that are predicted to be unstable by two-dimensional theory. This discrepancy between observations and theory has not yet been reconciled by a quantitative model. Here we present numerical simulations that show that long ruptures with oblique slip (both strike-slip and dip-slip components) can propagate steadily at various speeds, including those previously suggested to be unstable. The obliqueness of slip and the ratio of fracture energy to static energy release rate primarily control the propagation speed of long ruptures. We find that the effects of these controls on rupture speed can be predicted by extending the three-dimensional theory of fracture mechanics to long ruptures with oblique slip. This model advances our ability to interpret supershear earthquakes, to constrain the energy ratio of faults based on observed rupture speed and rake angle, and to relate the potential rupture speed and size of future earthquakes to the observed slip deficit along faults.","tags":null,"title":"Continuum of earthquake rupture speeds enabled by oblique slip","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"地震是拥有巨大破坏力的自然灾害，而我们对它的了解却十分有限。地震的发生源于地球板块接触面的相对摩擦滑动。该摩擦滑动并不是瞬时发生的，而是从接触面上的一个点开始向外逐渐扩张至整个断层面，其扩张速度称为地震破裂速度。地震破裂速度是地震学家尤为关心的物理量：地震破裂速度越大，则地面震动和地震破坏力就越强。\n传统破裂理论预测地震破裂面不能以任意速度扩张。科学家们因此得出，地震破裂速度存在一个理论的速度禁区，位于P波和S波波速之间（P波和S波为地球的两大主要地震波）。然而，最新的地震观测数据却显示该速度禁区并非不可能，例如造成了巨大人员伤亡的2018年印度尼西亚帕卢地震，其破裂速度快于S波波速（地球上大部分地震的破裂速度都低于S波波速）、且位于该理论速度禁区内。\n为解决传统破裂理论的困境，文章作者发展了一个新的模型可用于预测地震的破裂速度。该模型结合了最新的理论研究成果，并通过了高性能计算机支持的数值模拟结果验证。文章作者成功地克服了传统理论的两大关键限制。一，传统理论主要基于二维空间，而真实的地球是三维的；二，传统理论假设板块的相对错动方向是水平或垂直的，而真实的板块相对错动方向是倾斜的。考虑了这两个关键因素，新的模型预测地震破裂速度具有连续性 — “打破”了传统理论预测的速度禁区。\n","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"b48ffc19c9503584f6eff84e75d746d2","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/project/supershear_eqs/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/supershear_eqs/","section":"project","summary":"新的模型预测地震破裂速度具有连续性 — “打破”了传统理论预测的速度禁区","tags":["Supershear earthuakes"],"title":"预测地震破裂速度的新模型","type":"project"},{"authors":["Elif Oral","Huihui Weng","Jean-Paul Ampuero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578018237,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1578018237,"objectID":"58e6377935b3c6f9047cc835078ee357","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/publication/journal_papers/11-grl-2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_papers/11-grl-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Earthquakes are produced by slippage quickly unzipping along faults, causing Earth's vibrations, that is, ground shaking. The impact of the earthquake can become more catastrophic by triggered phenomena, like landslides and tsunamis, as witnessed during the 2018 Palu (Indonesia) earthquake of magnitude 7.5. Generally, the faster the earthquake rupture, the stronger the shaking. The Palu earthquake is among a class of very fast but rare earthquakes whose speed exceeds that of shearing waves in rocks. Theoretically, these so-called “supershear earthquakes” can propagate steadily only if faster than a speed known as Eshelby's speed. Surprisingly, the Palu earthquake is slower than this limit. How can we explain this unusual speed? Did it affect the triggering of landslides, including submarine landslides that likely contributed to the tsunami? We address these questions through computer simulations, particularly focusing on the possible effect of a “fault damage zone,” a layer of softened rocks surrounding faults and caused by rock fracturing accumulated throughout the past fault activity. We found that, if a damage zone exists around the Palu fault, it can explain the unusual speed of this supershear earthquake and may have had the beneficial effect of reducing the shaking and thus its induced landslide and tsunami hazards in Palu.","tags":null,"title":"Does a damaged fault zone mitigate the near-field impact of supershear earthquakes?

To do so, we estimate initial megathrust stress from locking by assuming that the entire slip deficit will be released in the next megathrust earthquake. Then we initiate spontaneous ruptures at the hypocenter of the 2012 Nicoya earthquake. We find scenarios that approximate the same coseismic slip distribution and final earthquake moment magnitude as obtained from seismic and geodetic observations, demonstrating that deriving potential rupture scenarios from interseismic locking is feasible. We also find that spontaneous rupture scenarios from different locking models differ in moment rate duration and thus ground motion prediction, although the final slip distribution and moment magnitude were similar.

Smaller earthquakes can also develop elongated ruptures due to confinement by heterogeneities of initial stresses or material properties. The energetics of such elongated ruptures is radically different from that of conventional circular crack models: they feature width-limited rather than length-dependent energy release rate. However, a synoptic understanding of their dynamics is still missing. Here we combine computational and analytical modeling of long ruptures in three dimension (3D) and 2.5D (width-averaged) to develop a theoretical relation between the evolution of rupture speed and the along-strike distribution of fault stress, fracture energy, and rupture width. We find that the evolution of elongated ruptures in our simulations is well described by the following rupture-tip-equation-of-motion,  equation 1,where Gc is the fracture energy, G0 is the steady state energy release rate, vs is the S wave speed, vr is the rupture speed,  urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb53646:jgrb53646-math-0002 is the rupture acceleration, and  urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb53646:jgrb53646-math-0003 is a known function of rupture speed. The steady energy release rate is limited by rupture width as G0 = γ∆τ2W/μ, where γ is a geometric factor, ∆τ is the stress drop (spatially smoothed over a length scale smaller than W), and μ is the shear modulus. If Gc is a constant and exactly balanced by G0, the rupture can in principle propagate steadily at any speed. If Gc increases with rupture speed, steady ruptures have a well-defined speed and are stable. When Gc ≠ G0, the rupture acquires an inertial effect: the rupture-tip-equation-of-motion depends explicitly on rupture acceleration. This inertial effect does not exist in the classical theory of dynamic rupture in 2-D unbounded media and in unbounded faults in 3D, but emerges in 2-D bounded media or, as shown here, as a consequence of the finite rupture width in 3D. These findings highlight the essential role of the seismogenic width on rupture dynamics. Based on the rupture-tip-equation-of-motion we define the rupture potential, a function that determines the size of next earthquake, and we propose a conceptual model that helps rationalize one type of “supercycles” observed on segmented faults. More generally, the theory developed here can yield relations between earthquake source properties (final magnitude, moment rate function, radiated energy) and the heterogeneities of stress and strength along the fault, which can then be used to extract statistical information on fault heterogeneity from source time functions of past earthquakes or as physics-based constraints on finite-fault source inversion and on seismic hazard assessment.","tags":null,"title":"The Dynamics of Elongated Earthquake Ruptures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng","Hongfeng Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532399037,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1532399037,"objectID":"52c7727ffd2c47c19d3f1f6e30f7a8fe","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/publication/journal_papers/8-jgr-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-24T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_papers/8-jgr-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Frictional properties of seismogenic faults play critical roles in earthquake generation and rupture propagation.

The seismic moments of these self-arresting ruptures increase with the nucleation size, forming nucleation-related events.

In contrast, ruptures become breakaway and tend to have high aspect ratios (\u003e8) if the seismogenic width is sufficiently large.

In addition, the promotional effects increase with the width and depth extent of damage fault zones. The overall effects of the waves reflected from the fault-parallel side boundaries of damage fault zones are unfavorable for rupture propagation. Therefore, rupture propagation is promoted with the increased width of fault zones due to geometrical spreading effects.

In this study, we apply the compressive sensing method (CS) to invert for the spatiotemporal distribution of the coseismic radiation at different frequencies of this event. The results show clear frequency-dependent feature of earthquake rupture with low-frequency (LF) radiation located in the updip region while high-frequency (HF) radiation concentrated in the downdip region of the megathrust. We also compare the CS results with three coseismic slip models as well as the stress drop distributions inferred from these slip models. The comparison confirms our understanding of coseismic radiation that energy sources are mostly located in the margin of large coseismic slip regions. Furthermore, we find that the LF radiation sources are mainly within the stress-decreasing (releasing) regions while the HF radiation sources are mainly located in the stress-increasing (loading) regions due to rupturing of relatively large asperities nearby (stress decreasing and releasing).

These so-called post-seismic deformations include contributions mainly from afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation, quantification of their relative influence is of importance for understanding the evolution of post-seismic crustal stress, strain and aftershocks. Here, we investigate the post-seismic deformation processes following the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake using surface displacement data as observed by the onshore global positioning system network in the first ∼1.5 yr following the main shock. We explore two different inversion modelling strategies: (i) we simulate pure afterslip and (ii) we simulate the combined effect of afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation. By assuming that the afterslip is solely responsible for the observed post-seismic deformation, we find most afterslip activities to be located close to the downdip area of the coseismic rupture at 20–80 km depth with a maximum cumulative slip of ∼3.8 m and a seismic moment of 2.3 × 1022 Nm, equivalent in moment to an Mw 8.84 earthquake. By assuming a combination of afterslip and viscoelastic components, the best data fit is found for an afterslip portion that is spatially consistent with the pure afterslip model, but reveals a decreased seismic moment of 2.1 × 1022 Nm, or Mw 8.82. In addition, the combined model suggests an effective thickness of the elastic crust of ∼50 km overlying an asthenosphere with a Maxwell viscosity of 2 × 1019 Pa s. Temporal analysis of our model inversions suggests that the rate of afterslip rapidly decreases with time, consistent with the state- and rate-strengthening frictional law. The spatial pattern of afterslip coincides with the locations of aftershocks, and also with the area of coseismically increased Coulomb failure stress (CFS). Only a small part of the coseismically increased CFS was released by the afterslip in 564 d after the event. The effect of the viscoelastic relaxation within this initial stage only plays a secondary role, but it shows an increasing tendency, that is, the contribution of viscoelastic relaxation increases with time. Further geodetic observations are needed for a robust quantification of the role of the viscoelastic relaxation in the post-seismic deformation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Overlapping post-seismic deformation processes: afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation following the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku (Japan) earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bd0e0cc6315645ce6f8f2fab41fc7d71","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/group/wangyangshang/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group/wangyangshang/","section":"group","summary":"研究方向：粘弹性介质的破裂规律","tags":null,"title":"尚王阳","type":"group"}]
