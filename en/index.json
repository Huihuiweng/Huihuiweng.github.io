Because slow slip events occur worldwide and could trigger devastating earthquakes, geophysicists are particularly interested in understanding their fundamental mechanics and their relationship with the fast, damaging earthquakes. A yet unsolved piece of the puzzle is the empirical relation between the magnitude and duration of both types of earthquakes: it is still debated whether or not this relation is similar for slow slip events and regular earthquakes.\nWe found that both slow and fast earthquakes can be understood by a new theory of dynamic fracture mechanics. This theory accounts for an essential ingredient that was missing in previous models and experiments, the “finite seismogenic depth”: the portion of the fault that slides during a large event has a limited depth extent, shorter than its horizontal length. The predictions of the new model are supported by validations against earthquake simulations and observations.\nThe work provides insight on how earthquakes can develop a broad spectrum of rupture speeds, from arbitrarily slow ones to seismic wave speeds. In particular, the new model shows how earthquake rupture speed is controlled by a non-dimensional number arising from energy balance: the ratio between the available elastic energy and the energy dissipated by fault slip. The model also reconciles the debated observations of the relation between magnitude and duration of slow slip events.

Seismological observations show that large earthquakes span a continuum of rupture speeds, from slower than Rayleigh waves up to P-wave speed, and include speeds that are predicted to be unstable by two-dimensional theory. This discrepancy between observations and theory has not yet been reconciled by a quantitative model. Here we present numerical simulations that show that long ruptures with oblique slip (both strike-slip and dip-slip components) can propagate steadily at various speeds, including those previously suggested to be unstable. The obliqueness of slip and the ratio of fracture energy to static energy release rate primarily control the propagation speed of long ruptures. We find that the effects of these controls on rupture speed can be predicted by extending the three-dimensional theory of fracture mechanics to long ruptures with oblique slip. This model advances our ability to interpret supershear earthquakes, to constrain the energy ratio of faults based on observed rupture speed and rake angle, and to relate the potential rupture speed and size of future earthquakes to the observed slip deficit along faults.","tags":null,"title":"Continuum of earthquake rupture speeds enabled by oblique slip","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Among the most damaging natural hazards, earthquakes are still today one of the least understood phenomena in Earth Sciences. Earthquakes happen when rocks on either side of a tectonic fault slide. The sliding, however, does not occur along the whole fault at once but starts at one point, the hypocenter, and then spreads over the entire fault at a speed known as the “rupture speed” of the earthquake. Geophysicists are particularly interested in rupture speeds because the faster they are, the stronger the seismic waves and therefore the greater the damage caused.\nSeismic models developed so far concluded that earthquakes could not propagate in a stable and sustainable way at arbitrary speeds. Scientists had therefore determined a forbidden speed range situated between the speed of P and S waves, the two main seismic waves that propagate through the Earth. However, progress in the seismological observation of earthquakes has made it possible to demonstrate that recent earthquakes had actually propagated within the forbidden range. Such was the case for the 2018 earthquake in Palu, Indonesia, for example, which caused a destructive tsunami.\nWe managed to overcome two crucial limitations of the previous models. The first was to rely on 2-dimensional models, while the Earth is 3-dimensional. The second was to assume either a horizontal or a vertical direction of sliding, while earthquake sliding can be oblique. By overcoming these two limitations, they were able to explain why the “forbidden speeds” are actually admissible.\n","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"b48ffc19c9503584f6eff84e75d746d2","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/project/supershear_eqs/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/supershear_eqs/","section":"project","summary":"We propose a new model predicting continuum of earthquake rupture speeds due to oblique sliding.","tags":["Supershear earthuakes"],"title":"A new model found to predict earthquake propagation speed","type":"project"},{"authors":["Elif Oral","Huihui Weng","Jean-Paul Ampuero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578018237,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578018237,"objectID":"58e6377935b3c6f9047cc835078ee357","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/11-grl-2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/11-grl-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Earthquakes are produced by slippage quickly unzipping along faults, causing Earth's vibrations, that is, ground shaking. The impact of the earthquake can become more catastrophic by triggered phenomena, like landslides and tsunamis, as witnessed during the 2018 Palu (Indonesia) earthquake of magnitude 7.5. Generally, the faster the earthquake rupture, the stronger the shaking. The Palu earthquake is among a class of very fast but rare earthquakes whose speed exceeds that of shearing waves in rocks. Theoretically, these so-called “supershear earthquakes” can propagate steadily only if faster than a speed known as Eshelby's speed. Surprisingly, the Palu earthquake is slower than this limit. How can we explain this unusual speed? Did it affect the triggering of landslides, including submarine landslides that likely contributed to the tsunami? We address these questions through computer simulations, particularly focusing on the possible effect of a “fault damage zone,” a layer of softened rocks surrounding faults and caused by rock fracturing accumulated throughout the past fault activity. We found that, if a damage zone exists around the Palu fault, it can explain the unusual speed of this supershear earthquake and may have had the beneficial effect of reducing the shaking and thus its induced landslide and tsunami hazards in Palu.","tags":null,"title":"Does a damaged fault zone mitigate the near-field impact of supershear earthquakes?

However, an individual earthquake's true rupture potential is challenging, as it depends on more than just a static image of prior locking. Here, we test the determinism of interseismic locking models using spontaneous rupture simulations and the well-resolved processes associated with the 2012 moment magnitude (Mw) 7.6 Nicoya earthquake. To do so, we estimate initial megathrust stress from locking by assuming that the entire slip deficit will be released in the next megathrust earthquake. Then we initiate spontaneous ruptures at the hypocenter of the 2012 Nicoya earthquake. We find scenarios that approximate the same coseismic slip distribution and final earthquake moment magnitude as obtained from seismic and geodetic observations, demonstrating that deriving potential rupture scenarios from interseismic locking is feasible. We also find that spontaneous rupture scenarios from different locking models differ in moment rate duration and thus ground motion prediction, although the final slip distribution and moment magnitude were similar. The results highlight that quantifying rupture scenarios and ground motions from reliable locking models by dynamic rupture simulations can be an effective tool for seismic hazard assessment in subduction zones.","tags":null,"title":"Deriving rupture scenarios from interseismic locking distributions along the subduction megathrust","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567382400,"objectID":"0064615b7ffe5b784fa8c756ba3bbec7","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/teaching/ictp/","publishdate":"2019-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/teaching/ictp/","section":"teaching","summary":"2019 Advanced Workshop on Earthquake Fault Mechanics: Theory, Simulation and Observations at ICTP, Trieste, Italy","tags":null,"title":"2019 International summer schools","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The dynamics of ruptures in 3-D dynamic rupture simulations can be well described by the following inertial equation-of-motion:\n$F(G_c/G_0) = M(v_r) \\cdot \\dot{v}_r$\nwhere $G_c$ is the fracture energy, $G_0$ is the static energy release rate, $v_r$ is the ruptuer speed, $\\dot{v}_r$ is the rupture acceleration, $F()$ and $M()$ are the known “Force” and “Mass” terms.\n","date":1565740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565740800,"objectID":"3ee6e4919b28ed93ce01a713585018ab","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/project/equation-of-motion/","publishdate":"2019-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/equation-of-motion/","section":"project","summary":"We develop a new 3D theory to describe the rupture propagation in a fault with finite width.","tags":["Rupture dynamics"],"title":"New theory for elongated ruptures","type":"project"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng*","Jean-Paul Ampuero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564453437,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564453437,"objectID":"9deffcd9252586248604c2d3e8371abc","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/10-jgr-2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-30T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/10-jgr-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The largest earthquakes propagate laterally after saturating the fault's seismogenic width and reach large length-to-width ratios L/W. Smaller earthquakes can also develop elongated ruptures due to confinement by heterogeneities of initial stresses or material properties. The energetics of such elongated ruptures is radically different from that of conventional circular crack models: they feature width-limited rather than length-dependent energy release rate. However, a synoptic understanding of their dynamics is still missing. Here we combine computational and analytical modeling of long ruptures in three dimension (3D) and 2.5D (width-averaged) to develop a theoretical relation between the evolution of rupture speed and the along-strike distribution of fault stress, fracture energy, and rupture width. We find that the evolution of elongated ruptures in our simulations is well described by the following rupture-tip-equation-of-motion,  equation 1,where Gc is the fracture energy, G0 is the steady state energy release rate, vs is the S wave speed, vr is the rupture speed,  urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb53646:jgrb53646-math-0002 is the rupture acceleration, and  urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb53646:jgrb53646-math-0003 is a known function of rupture speed. The steady energy release rate is limited by rupture width as G0 = γ∆τ2W/μ, where γ is a geometric factor, ∆τ is the stress drop (spatially smoothed over a length scale smaller than W), and μ is the shear modulus. If Gc is a constant and exactly balanced by G0, the rupture can in principle propagate steadily at any speed. If Gc increases with rupture speed, steady ruptures have a well-defined speed and are stable. When Gc ≠ G0, the rupture acquires an inertial effect: the rupture-tip-equation-of-motion depends explicitly on rupture acceleration. This inertial effect does not exist in the classical theory of dynamic rupture in 2-D unbounded media and in unbounded faults in 3D, but emerges in 2-D bounded media or, as shown here, as a consequence of the finite rupture width in 3D. These findings highlight the essential role of the seismogenic width on rupture dynamics. Based on the rupture-tip-equation-of-motion we define the rupture potential, a function that determines the size of next earthquake, and we propose a conceptual model that helps rationalize one type of “supercycles” observed on segmented faults. More generally, the theory developed here can yield relations between earthquake source properties (final magnitude, moment rate function, radiated energy) and the heterogeneities of stress and strength along the fault, which can then be used to extract statistical information on fault heterogeneity from source time functions of past earthquakes or as physics-based constraints on finite-fault source inversion and on seismic hazard assessment.","tags":null,"title":"The Dynamics of Elongated Earthquake Ruptures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng","Hongfeng Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532399037,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532399037,"objectID":"52c7727ffd2c47c19d3f1f6e30f7a8fe","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/8-jgr-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-24T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/8-jgr-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Frictional properties of seismogenic faults play critical roles in earthquake generation and rupture propagation. Although laboratory measurements have well revealed the frictional parameters of a variety of rock samples, those on seismogenic faults remain difficult to determine due to the strong trade-off between critical slip-weakening distance (d0) and strength drop. Here we conduct dynamic rupture simulations to determine the frictional parameters on the fault where the 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake occurred, with constraints from near-field seismic and geodetic observations, and kinematic source models. By utilizing different trade-off patterns of source parameters and multiple observations for the first time, we can determine the frictional parameters of the seismogenic fault. The best fit dynamic model yields a d0value of ~0.6 m, in contrast to the previous kinematical estimation of ~5 m (Galetzka et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac6383). The average fracture energy of this event is urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb52922:jgrb52922-math-0001 J/m2.

If the seismogenic width is smaller than a critical value, then ruptures cannot break the entire fault, regardless of the size of the nucleation zone. The seismic moments of these self-arresting ruptures increase with the nucleation size, forming nucleation-related events. The aspect ratios increase with the seismogenic width but are smaller than 8. In contrast, ruptures become breakaway and tend to have high aspect ratios (\u003e8) if the seismogenic width is sufficiently large. But the critical nucleation size is larger than the theoretical estimate for an unbounded fault. The eventual seismic moments of breakaway ruptures do not depend on the nucleation size.

We find that damage fault zones can promote rupture extent and increase earthquake potency. The waves reflected from the bottom of shallow damage fault zones can increase shear stress on the fault and thus promote rupture propagation. In addition, the promotional effects increase with the width and depth extent of damage fault zones. The overall effects of the waves reflected from the fault-parallel side boundaries of damage fault zones are unfavorable for rupture propagation. Therefore, rupture propagation is promoted with the increased width of fault zones due to geometrical spreading effects. Moreover, nonground-breaking ruptures may reach the ground surface with the effects of damage fault zones. Furthermore, along-strike segmented fault zones as suggested by observations could also promote ruptures and may lead to preferred rupture directions if epicenters are close to fault zones. The effects of damage fault zones on rupture propagation hold important implications on assessing earthquake risk.","tags":null,"title":"Earthquake rupture extents and coseismic slips promoted by damaged fault zones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiuxun Yin","Hongfeng Yang","Huajian Yao","Huihui Weng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1453947837,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1453947837,"objectID":"6e830886ffb41975db8bb1c7cf564cc7","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/5-grl-2016/","publishdate":"2016-01-28T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/5-grl-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"On 16 September 2015, an Mw 8.3 earthquake struck middle Chile due to the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South America plate. This earthquake is the consequence of 72 years of strain accumulation in the region since the 1943 M 8.3 event. In this study, we apply the compressive sensing method (CS) to invert for the spatiotemporal distribution of the coseismic radiation at different frequencies of this event. The results show clear frequency-dependent feature of earthquake rupture with low-frequency (LF) radiation located in the updip region while high-frequency (HF) radiation concentrated in the downdip region of the megathrust. We also compare the CS results with three coseismic slip models as well as the stress drop distributions inferred from these slip models. The comparison confirms our understanding of coseismic radiation that energy sources are mostly located in the margin of large coseismic slip regions. Furthermore, we find that the LF radiation sources are mainly within the stress-decreasing (releasing) regions while the HF radiation sources are mainly located in the stress-increasing (loading) regions due to rupturing of relatively large asperities nearby (stress decreasing and releasing). These results help to better understand the physics of the rupture process during megathrust earthquakes. Moreover, our results do not show radiation sources south of the epicenter, suggesting that the subducting Juan Fernandez Ridge probably stopped the rupture of this earthquake toward the south.","tags":null,"title":"Coseismic radiation and stress drop during the 2015 Mw8.3 Illapel, Chile megathrust earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng","Jinshui Huang","Hongfeng Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1433298237,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433298237,"objectID":"5a11238ae3c33bbcce3cf8684c9a078e","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/4-grl-2015/","publishdate":"2015-06-03T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/4-grl-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Here we investigate the effects of a patch with elevated effective normal stress (barrier) on two-dimensional in-plane supershear rupture propagation on a planar fault from numerical experiments. Our results confirm that the barrier may slow down or stop coseismic ruptures but may also induce supershear ruptures. We demonstrate that the supershear rupture may emerge in a region that is delineated by two approximate linear boundaries. If the barrier size is below the lower boundary, ruptures can overcome the barrier and propagate at subshear speeds. If the barrier size is larger than the upper boundary, ruptures are always stopped by the barrier. Furthermore, we find that the barrier-induced supershear ruptures may eventually slow down into subshear speed, depending on the size and the location of the barrier. The duration of supershear ruptures increases as the barrier sizes grow from the lower to the upper boundary, which are proportional to the reduction in rupture speeds caused by the barrier. These results indicate that a barrier on the fault may not stop coseismic ruptures. Rather, the barrier may induce ruptures propagating at supershear speeds that play important roles in near-field ground shaking and damage.","tags":null,"title":"Barrier-induced supershear ruptures on a slip-weakening fault","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng","Jinshui Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420079037,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420079037,"objectID":"4045423a8b9497aa2f4ebd0159dd3cea","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/3-jgg-2015/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/3-jgg-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Numerical simulations about subduction earthquake cycles: The case of Japan Tohoku Mw9.0 earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng","Jinshui Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420079037,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420079037,"objectID":"7677c9b4e603ce9a235aa7699046a599","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/2-ass-2015/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/2-ass-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Numerical simulations about the influence of stress disturbance on earthquake cycle and seismic moment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Faqi Diao","Xiong Xiong","Rongjiang Wang","Yong Zheng","Thomas R Walter","Huihui Weng","Jun Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388543037,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388543037,"objectID":"c4e117769ffc83fb577dfe4a7c5b6676","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/en/publication/journal_papers/1-gji-2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/journal_papers/1-gji-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Large tectonic earthquakes lead to significant deformations in the months and years thereafter. These so-called post-seismic deformations include contributions mainly from afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation, quantification of their relative influence is of importance for understanding the evolution of post-seismic crustal stress, strain and aftershocks. Here, we investigate the post-seismic deformation processes following the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake using surface displacement data as observed by the onshore global positioning system network in the first ∼1.5 yr following the main shock. We explore two different inversion modelling strategies: (i) we simulate pure afterslip and (ii) we simulate the combined effect of afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation. By assuming that the afterslip is solely responsible for the observed post-seismic deformation, we find most afterslip activities to be located close to the downdip area of the coseismic rupture at 20–80 km depth with a maximum cumulative slip of ∼3.8 m and a seismic moment of 2.3 × 1022 Nm, equivalent in moment to an Mw 8.84 earthquake. By assuming a combination of afterslip and viscoelastic components, the best data fit is found for an afterslip portion that is spatially consistent with the pure afterslip model, but reveals a decreased seismic moment of 2.1 × 1022 Nm, or Mw 8.82. In addition, the combined model suggests an effective thickness of the elastic crust of ∼50 km overlying an asthenosphere with a Maxwell viscosity of 2 × 1019 Pa s. Temporal analysis of our model inversions suggests that the rate of afterslip rapidly decreases with time, consistent with the state- and rate-strengthening frictional law. The spatial pattern of afterslip coincides with the locations of aftershocks, and also with the area of coseismically increased Coulomb failure stress (CFS). Only a small part of the coseismically increased CFS was released by the afterslip in 564 d after the event. The effect of the viscoelastic relaxation within this initial stage only plays a secondary role, but it shows an increasing tendency, that is, the contribution of viscoelastic relaxation increases with time. Further geodetic observations are needed for a robust quantification of the role of the viscoelastic relaxation in the post-seismic deformation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Overlapping post-seismic deformation processes: afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation following the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku (Japan) earthquake","type":"publication"}]
